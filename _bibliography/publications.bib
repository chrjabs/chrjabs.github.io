  abstract    = {State-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers constitute a practical and competitive approach for solving various real-world problems.
                 To encourage their widespread adoption, the relatively high barrier of entry following from the low level syntax of SAT and the expert knowledge required to achieve tight integration with SAT solvers should be further reduced.
                 We present RustSAT, a library with the aim of making SAT solving technology readily available in the Rust programming language.
                 RustSAT provides functionality for helping with generating (Max)SAT instances, writing them to, or reading them from files.
                 Furthermore, RustSAT includes interfaces to various state-of-the-art SAT solvers available with a unified Rust API.
                 Lastly, RustSAT implements several encodings for higher level constraints (at-most-one, cardinality, and pseudo-Boolean), which are also available via a C and Python API.},

                 Building upon the distributed job scheduling and SAT solving platform Mallob, we present the first MaxSAT solver that scales to hundreds of cores through a careful combination of parallel and distributed incremental SAT solving, task parallelism and flexible load balancing, and clause sharing within and across SAT solving tasks.
                 Experiments on up to 768 cores (16 nodes) show that our approach clearly outscales state-of-the-art SIS-based MaxSAT solvers, marking a new baseline for parallel MaxSAT solving.},

                 For Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers - and more recently SAT-based maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solvers - trustworthiness is obtained by integrating proof logging into solvers, making solvers capable of emitting machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness of the reasoning steps performed.
                 In this work, we enable for the first time proof logging based on the VeriPB proof format for multi-objective MaxSAT (MO-MaxSAT) optimization techniques.
                 Although VeriPB does not offer direct support for multi-objective problems, we detail how preorders in VeriPB can be used to provide certificates for MO-MaxSAT algorithms computing a representative solution for each element in the non-dominated set of the search space under Pareto optimality, without extending the VeriPB format or the proof checker.
                 By implementing VeriPB proof logging into a state-of-the-art multi-objective MaxSAT solver, we show empirically that proof logging can be made scalable for MO-MaxSAT with reasonable overhead.},

                 Most work on practical declarative solvers---ranging from classical integer programming to finite-domain constraint optimization and maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT)---has focused on optimization under a single objective; fewer advances have been made towards efficient declarative techniques for multi-objective optimization problems.
                 Motivated by significant recent advances in practical solvers for MaxSAT, in this work we develop BiOptSat, an exact declarative  approach for finding Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems, with propositional logic as the underlying constraint language.
                 BiOptSat can be viewed as an instantiation of the lexicographic method.
                 The approach makes use of a single Boolean satisfiability solver that is incrementally employed throughout the entire search procedure, allowing  for finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, finding one representative solution for each non-dominated point, and enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.
                 We detail several algorithmic instantiations of BiOptSat, each building on recent algorithms proposed for single-objective MaxSAT.
                 We empirically evaluate the instantiations compared to recently-proposed alternative approaches to multi-objective MaxSAT solving on several real-world domains from the literature, showing the practical benefits of our approach.},

                 Core boosting in the multi-objective setting allows for shrinking the ranges of the multiple objectives at hand, which can be particularly beneficial for MO-MaxSAT relying on search that requires enforcing increasingly tighter objective bounds through propositional encodings.
                 We show that core boosting is effective in improving the runtime performance of SAT-based MO-MaxSAT solvers with typically little overhead.

                 This results in a need for non-trivial algorithmic approaches for finding optimal solutions to such problems.
                 Many such approaches—ranging from probabilistic and meta-heuristic algorithms to declarative programming—have been presented for optimization problems with a single objective.
                 Less work has been done on approaches for optimization problems with multiple objectives.
                 
                 We present BiOptSat, an exact declarative approach for finding so-called Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems.
                 A bi-objective optimization problem arises for example when learning interpretable classifiers and the size, as well as the classification error of the classifier should be taken into account as objectives.
                 Using propositional logic as a declarative programming language, we seek to extend the progress and success in maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving to two objectives.
                 BiOptSat can be viewed as an instantiation of the lexicographic method and makes use of a single SAT solver that is preserved throughout the entire search procedure.
                 It allows for solving three tasks for bi-objective optimization: finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, finding one representative solution for each Pareto point, and enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.
                 
                 We provide an open-source implementation of five variants of BiOptSat, building on different algorithms proposed for MaxSAT.
                 Additionally, we empirically evaluate these five variants, comparing their runtime performance to that of three key competing algorithmic approaches.
                 The empirical comparison in the contexts of learning interpretable decision rules and bi-objective set covering shows practical benefits of our approach.
                 Furthermore, for the best-performing variant of BiOptSat, we study the effects of proposed refinements to determine their effectiveness.},

                 Bi-objective optimization refers to the task of finding so-called Pareto-optimal solutions in terms of two objective functions.
                 Bi-objective optimization problems naturally arise in various real-world settings.
                 For example, in the context of learning interpretable representations, such as decision rules, from data, one wishes to balance between two objectives, the classification error and the size of the representation.
                 Our approach is generally applicable to bi-objective optimizations which allow for propositional encodings.
                 The approach makes heavy use of incremental SAT and draws inspiration from modern MaxSAT solving approaches.
                 In particular, we describe several variants of the approach which arise from different approaches to MaxSAT solving.
                 In addition to computing a single representative solution per each point of the Pareto front, the approach allows for enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.

  abstract    = {A common approach in current research publication on analysing multimodal time-series data from inertial sensors is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically learn patterns in the given data.
                 The disadvantage when using CNNs in such an application on mobile devices is that they are highly computationally complex.
                 Therefore, this thesis studies the question if Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks, which are significantly less computationally complex, can be used as an alternative for such applications.
                 
                 Firstly the topic of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and the used datasets Opportunity and mHealth are presented.
                 Following that, inertial sensors and their functional principles are briefly touched on.
                 In the main part of the work, the methods used, mainly LSTMs and CNNs are laid out.
                 In our experiments, we mainly present an architecture study in which 380 LSTM variants were trained and tested on the Opportunity dataset.
                 A modified training process called Relaxed Truth Training that speeds up the training process slightly is also presented and tested in our experiments.
                 When comparing the best two LSTM networks from the architecture study to two different CNN architectures, we found superior performance from the LSTMs, mainly when looking at close to real life, continuous classification problems.
                 These results were verified by testing the same architectures on the mHealth dataset.},
